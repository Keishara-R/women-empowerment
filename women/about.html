		<p>When more women articulate, they can contribute in a unique way, by communicating and highlighting all those SPECIAL aspects that are exclusive and IMPORTANT to all women. So, literacy empowers their intellect. Their opinion gets a hearing. When highly evolved intelligent among them get recognition, it is wonderful to be also 'ruled' by them! </p>

<P>The pre-production phase is where we gather our vision of what your video will be about and how to make it!
The video production process is the planning, and the organizing of the work we need to before  the shooting starts.
The video's concept, the video production storyboard is a step that can help keep us organized and moving forward when we were producing our video. Our storyboard were basically Pictures, Sketches and Drawings, and last but not least our Props.</P>
